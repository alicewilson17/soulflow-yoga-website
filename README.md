# Soulflow Yoga Studio Website

A modern and responsive website for a yoga studio, built using React and styled with CSS.  

I designed the UI for this website using Figma, to create a clean, user-friendly experience.

This project was created using Vite for fast development and build performance.

Currently, this project is a front-end only application, but I plan to incorporate back-end functionality in the future.
